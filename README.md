### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Diagram

[cite_start]Here is a high-level overview of the system architecture[cite: 90].

![Project Screenshot](./fronend/public/System Architecture.png)
``

The flow is as follows:
1.  **Frontend (React/Next.js)** interacts with the Backend API.
2.  **Backend API (Node.js/Spring Boot)** handles authentication, validation, and core business logic.
3.  [cite_start]For data ingestion, the API publishes jobs to a **Message Broker (Redis Streams)**.
4.  [cite_start]A separate **Consumer Service** picks up these jobs and writes data to the **Database (MySQL/MongoDB)**.
5.  [cite_start]Campaign delivery calls a **Mock Vendor API**, which calls back to a **Delivery Receipt API** on our backend[cite: 31, 34].
6.  [cite_start]AI features are powered by making API calls to an **External AI Service (OpenAI/Google Vertex AI)**[cite: 59].

### üîß Local Setup Instructions

[cite_start]Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine[cite: 89].

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repo URL]
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Setup Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` (or backend) directory. Use the `.env.example` file as a template for the required variables like database connection strings, Google OAuth credentials, AI API keys, etc.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # For the backend
    cd server
    npm install

    # For the frontend
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    # Run the backend server
    cd server
    npm start

    # Run the frontend development server
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

5.  The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Assumptions

[cite_start]A list of known limitations and assumptions made during development[cite: 92].

* **Mock Vendor API:** The campaign delivery system connects to a mock vendor API that simulates success/failure. A real-world implementation would require robust integration with a real email/SMS provider.
* **No Drag-and-Drop:** The audience rule builder is based on dropdowns and inputs for functionality. A visual drag-and-drop interface was considered but scoped out to focus on core backend logic.
* **Simulated Data:** The customer and order data used for the demo is pre-seeded and does not represent real user activity patterns.
